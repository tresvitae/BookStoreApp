# Book Store App
Google&amp;Udacity Android Basics Scholarship - Inventory App (stage 1 and 2)

This is the final project in Android Basics Nanodegree organised by Google&Udacity.

The App includes:
- Creating a SQLite table in app
- Populating that table with new entries
- Modifying the entries
- Displaying the contents of the table to users.
- Storing information in a SQLite database
- Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
- Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
- Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
- Updating information based on user input
- Creating intents to other apps using stored information
    
The application implements ContentProvider on an SQLite database, 
performing the operations called CRUD: CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE.

It uses a CursorAdapter to created a listView in the main activity. Clicking on the FAB 
button will bring you to the insert screen with empty fields. Clicking on an particular 
item in the listView will bring you to a particular product with updated data from SQLite. 
Also, in the listView there is a sale button that reduces the quantity by 1 when pressed and 
set to off when the value is equal to 0.

ListView displays information like Product Name, Price and Quantity of product from the database.

In the update screen there are save and delete buttons on the action bar, increase and decrease 
buttons to change the total of quantity's product. Also contains order button to open the dialer 
phone with the phone number of the supplier.
